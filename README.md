## 🔴About
**Across Java** is a typing, platformer indie video game that follow Gatotkaca, our main protagonist on his journey towards Bima. Across Java followed a story of Gatotkaca’s moments before his eventual demise, though the time of that said demise was uncertain. Was it when the Konta’s bow shot his chest or was it at the road ? If it was during his journey, when was it, exactly ? A dying man’s eyes vision could get blurry at times. Even if Gatotkaca knew the moment of his death, was he certain that time worked properly. Across the journey, he would saw different things, different backgrounds. Things are different, yet still so similar. Gatotkaca felt the world was moving back and forth so quickly, or was it all in his mind ? Is there even still blood flowing through that head of Gatotkaca ?
